 Ready to Die is the debut studio album of American rapper The Notorious B.I.G., released September 13, 1994 on Bad Boy Records. Recording sessions for the album took place from 1993 to 1994 at The Hit Factory and D&D Studios in New York City.

The partly autobiographical hardcore hip hop album gained strong reviews on release and became a commercial success, reaching quadruple platinum sales. It was significant for revitalizing East Coast hip hop at a time when the genre was mostly dominated by West Coast artists. In 2006, Time magazine named it one of the 100 greatest albums of all time. It was nominated for Best Rap Solo Performance for "Big Poppa" at the 1996 Grammy Awards. It also won 2 Awards at the Billboard Music Awards.
