 The T.I.M.E. soundtrack is one of Odd Nosdams' more accessible pieces of work and was used as the soundtrack of a skateboarding DVD called "This Is My Element" (T.I.M.E). It has all his trademark lush soundscapes, weird drum sound patterns, broken loops, loads of tape hiss and strange blips and buzzing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Odd+Nosdam/T.I.M.E.+Soundtrack">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
