 Drug Church is an American five-piece hardcore punk / alternative rock band from Albany, United States that formed in 2011. They feature Patrick Kindlon of End of a Year/Self Defense Family on vocals, and also share members with Push-Pit, as well as Self Defense Family.

The band is currently signed to Pure Noise Records 

Hardcore plays a much more prominent role in their music than Self Defense Family, with chugging guitar parts with a sound big enough to recall bands such as Quicksand. Kindlon's spits words in his aggressive and dramatic voice, with a bit of a snarl added. Lyrically, they stay as socially aware and satirical as Self Defense Family, just with that hardcore punk edge and bite emphasized. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drug+Church">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
