 Violadores del Verso (Spanish: Verse Violators or Verse Rapists), also known as Doble V, are a rap music crew from Zaragoza, Spain. They used the name Doble V but were forced to return to their original long name due to legal issues (Doble V is also the trademark of a Spanish whiskey). The band members are MCs Kase-O, LÃ­rico, Hate (AKA Maestro Sho Hai) and DJ R de Rumba.

Violadores del Verso started off in 1998 in Zaragoza, Spain. They were initially 5 mc's, but Brutal (Kase.O's brother) left the group. In 1999 they published their first LP like a group, which increased their popularity in the Spanish rap scene. They had legal problems with a whiskey company called Doble V so they changed back the name of the group to their original name Violadores del Verso. In 2001 they published two more albums as Doble V. In 2006 they published their bestseller "Vivir para contarlo". <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Violadores+del+Verso">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
