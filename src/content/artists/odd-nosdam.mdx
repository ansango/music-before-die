 Odd Nosdam, real name David Madson, from Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, is a visual artist, DJ, record producer and member of the Anticon hip hop collective. Madson has performed in, produced and designed cover art for the alternative hip-hop bands Greenthink, cLOUDDEAD and Reaching Quiet, as well as releasing a variety of solo works, including Burner (2005, Anticon), No More Wig For Ohio (2003, Anticon), Reject Odd Nosdam (2001, self released), and Plan 9, Meat Your Hypnotis... (1999, self released). Nosdam has toured with, remixed, produced, mixed and collaborated with a wide variety of artists including: Boards of Canada, Mike Patton, m√∫m, Jessica Bailiff, Thee More Shallows, Serena-Maneesh, Jel, Why?, Fog, Dosh, Sole, Alias, Hood, Peeping Tom (album)

Most of his early works were released initially only on a limited number of hand-made cassettes and distributed entirely through the internet and tape trading, the cLOUDDEAD s/t LP Plan 9, Meat Your Hypnotis... were created during the winter of 1998 into the spring of 1999 using only a Dr. Sample, a cassette deck, and his "trusty" Tascam 8-Track. The re-release of the 55-track beat tape by Mush kept all of the original clicks, pops, tape noise, and hiss intact. Odd Nosdam's musical style is heavily influenced by ambient soundscapes, 70's dub, late 80's/early 90's hip hop production as well as indie rock, preferring older musical equipment (Dr. Sample Sp-202, E-MU SP1200), to create a rounded, warm mush of sound fortified with inspired beats.

His chosen pseudonym is a play on the name of the Norwegian artist Odd Nerdrum, combined with his last name backwards. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Odd+Nosdam">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.
