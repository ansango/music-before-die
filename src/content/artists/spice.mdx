 There are 2 artists known as Spice:

 1. Jamaican dancehall recording artist, singer, and songwriter Grace Latoya Hamilton (born 6 August 1982), known professionally as Spice. Referred to as the "Queen of Dancehall", Spice is recognised as one of the most prominent dancehall artists in the world.
Beginning her career in the early 2000s, Spice had her first major success with the controversial single "Romping Shop" with Vybz Kartel in 2009. She subsequently signed with VP Records, and released her debut EP, So Mi Like It (2014), which was preceded by the single of the same name. In 2018, Spice joined the cast of VH1's reality television series Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta in season seven, after appearing as a guest star in season six.
Spice's first full-length project, a mixtape titled Captured (2018), was released independently and debuted at number one on the Billboard Reggae Albums chart. It was preceded by the single "Black Hypocrisy", which addresses the issue of colorism in the black community. Captured was released following a dispute with Spice's record label over the release of her long-delayed debut studio album, Ten (2021).

2. L.A. based indie band Spice, formed in 2018 and based across California, each members’ roots are in the North Bay of San Francisco. Comprised of Ross Farrar (vocals) and Jake Casarotti (drums), both of Ceremony, along with Cody Sullivan (bass), Ian Simpson (guitar), and Victoria Skudlarek (violin), Spice’s sound pulls from the sense of melody and drive inherent to Bay Area pedigree, peppered with modernity and awash with an anthemic haze. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Spice">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
