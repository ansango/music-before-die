 Moderat are Modeselektor and Apparat.

Moderat's formation began back in 2002 in Berlin, Germany when Sascha Ring (aka Apparat) and Gernot Bronsert and Sebastian Szary (aka Modeselektor) recorded an EP for the record label BPitch Control ("Auf Kosten der Gesundheit"). When it came time to begin working on an album, Moderat suddenly broke up.

Meanwhile Modeselektor set a milestone in German music history with their sophomore album, Happy Birthday!, including musicians such as Puppetmastaz, Maximo Park and Thom Yorke. Amongst a slew of remixes for the likes of Thom Yorke and Bj√∂rk, Modeselektor also went on to tour with Radiohead across Japan in 2008.

Apparat, on the other hand, moved forward with his album Walls in 2007 (after his collaboration with Ellen Allien on "Orchestra of Bubbles"), taking a musical path that was more band-oriented and kept him on tour for several years running.

2008 saw the reunion of this project and the three members of Moderat went back to the studio to continue working together and finally released their 1st full album "Moderat" in April 2009. This is a monumental 'audio-visual declaration' album, which includes ten videos by Berlin's highly regarded visualists Pfadfinderei.
